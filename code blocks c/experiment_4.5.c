/*An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity.
- For the first 200 units: 80 paise per unit
- For the next 100 units: Rs. 1.30 per unit
- Beyond 300 units: Rs. 2.00 per unit
All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more that Rs. 400, then
an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of a
consumer and the number of units consumed and print the charge with his/her name*/
